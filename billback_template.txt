Hi Team,

This is in reference to the validation done on the below deduction taken for shortages of {{ amount }} on invoice# {{ invoice_number }}, PO# {{ po_number }}. Per our further validation from the attached POD/BOL and delivery receipt, the deduction seems to be invalid.

Kindly review and repay the deducted amount at your earliest convenience.

Account    Customer Name    Invoice#    PO#    Reason    Amount 
{{ account }}    {{ customer_name }}    {{ invoice_number }}    {{ po_number }}    Shortage    {{ amount }}

Please review attached supporting documents and provide repayment for invalid shortages. If this has already been paid, kindly provide me check information so that I can clear the cases from my books.
If you have any documentation which states valid shortages, kindly share the same.
Appreciate your help and quick response in this matter.

Thanks & Regards
Deduction Analyst
